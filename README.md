Addressing essentials of cryptography

### 1. Prime number generation
Prime numbers are fundamental to modern cryptography because they provide the mathematical foundation for secure encryption systems, especially in public-key cryptography. 
* Prime numbers enable the creation of asymmetric encryption keys </br>
* A public key can be widely shared, while the private key remains secret </br>
* The security depends on the extreme difficulty of determining the private key from the public key </br>

### 2. Encryption and decryption technique 
This is an essential technology that underpins digital security, protecting our most sensitive information from unauthorised access and potential cyber threats.
* Symmetric cryptography
Uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption </br>
Faster and more computationally efficient </br>

* Asymmetric cryptography
Uses a pair of keys as public key (for encryption) and private key (for decryption) </br>
More secure for key exchange and digital signatures </br>
